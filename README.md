# skript-gui
Simple syntax to create advanced and organized GUIs with Skript.


This addon allows you to create custom GUIs with Skript.
It is a remake of TuSKe's (by Tuke_Nuke - https://github.com/Tuke-Nuke/TuSKe) advanced GUI system.
That system was abandoned and has become very outdated, so I decided to create this one.

Little has changed syntax-wise if you were already using TuSKe's advanced GUI system.
However, please be sure to check out the wiki! The wiki links are listed below.

If you run into any issues, have questions, or want a new feature added, please let me know in the "Issues" category!
